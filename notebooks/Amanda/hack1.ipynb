    "* Run Unet picks, seisbench picks with Earthquake Transformer, and download PhaseNet picks from a station of your choice.  Plot each set of picks along with their associated waveforms.  Which picks seem most robust?  What are the differences?\n",
    "* Run a picker of your choice on a set of stations surrounding the Ferndale earthquake for an hour after the mainshock.  Plot the pick timing vs. station position (e.g. longitude, or distance from the epicenter).  Do the temporal and spatial distribution of the picks reflect moveout?  What fraction of picks seem to be legitimate?  What ways you can think of to do quality control on picks?"
