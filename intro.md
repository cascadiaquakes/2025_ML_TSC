# 2025 CRESCENT Machine Learning Technical Short Course

## Program Overview
This three-day short course provides a hands-on introduction to machine learning techniques for seismic event analysis. Participants will learn to develop AI-aided earthquake catalogs through three key steps: event detection, association, and location with quality control. The course covers neural network architecture selection, model training, performance metrics, and application to continuous seismic data. The workshop will include a mix of presentations and hands-on tutorials.  The final day will include a participant hack-a-thon in which students attempt to develop a machine learning based quality control workflow to apply to future generations of machine learning earthquake catalogs.

## Learning Goals and Objectives

By the end of this short course, participants will be able to: 

- Explain the role of machine learning in earthquake detection, association, and location. 
- Select appropriate neural network architectures for earthquake detection and phase picking. 
- Train models using labeled seismic datasets and evaluate their performance. 
- Implement trained models to detect and associate seismic events in real-world data. 
- Optimize model parameters for accuracy and efficiency in earthquake cataloging. 
- Integrate machine learning outputs into earthquake location algorithms. 
- Assess model predictions and refine event catalogs through quality control methods. 
- Design end-to-end machine learning workflows tailored to specific seismic networks or research needs. 
- Collaborate on participant-led exercises to improve catalog quality and reliability.
